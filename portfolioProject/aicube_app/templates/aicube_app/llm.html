    <h3>Chatbots</h3>
    <p>Chatbots are virtual assistants designed to simulate conversation with human users, 
        especially over the internet. They are developed using various artificial intelligence 
        (AI) technologies, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, 
        to understand and respond to user queries effectively. Chatbots can range from simple, 
        rule-based systems that respond to specific prompts, to more advanced AI-driven bots 
        that learn from interactions to provide more natural and valuable conversations.
    </p>

    <h4>Overview of existing bots</h4>
    <p>Among the most advanced chatbots available today are ChatGPT and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, 
        Bard by Google, and Bing Chat by Microsoft. Below is some statistics about their
        models.

    <h4>Prompting</h4>
    <p>Prompting is the process of communicating with a chatbot by giving it specific 
        instructions or asking questions. It's a critical component in the interaction
        between humans and AI, as the quality of the prompt can significantly influence
        the quality of the bot's response. The three main things to keep in mind when
        writing a prompt is:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clarity - Make sure your prompt is easy to understand and be specific about what you're asking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conciseness - Don't overload the prompt with unnecessary information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Context - Provide relevant background information that relates to your query.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h5>Examples</h5>
    <p>DALL-E 3, also from OpenAI, is an AI system but with a different purpose than chatbots. It's designed to generate images from textual descriptions, showcasing the AI's understanding of both the components of the image and the artistic styles requested. The ability to "prompt" DALL-E effectively is a skill, as the descriptions need to be both creative and precise to yield the best results.</p>

    <h3>DALL-E</h3>
    <p>DALL-E is a generative model for images. It takes textual descriptions and generates 
        corresponding images, creating new visual content that matches the descriptions it 
        receives.
