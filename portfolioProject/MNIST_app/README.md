# Overview

### MNIST Prediction
This project is a basic machine learning model, trained using the MNIST dataset, to accurately predict handwritten numbers from the user between 0 to 9. I also created some synthetic data by slightly rotating the images to improve the model. The front-end design is made to mimic a university chalkboard.
